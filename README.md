# Tidy Data Assignment

This repository contains the script, output.txt and code book for the final assignment.
You can read the output.txt by using:
read.table("output.txt", header = TRUE)

For the script to work the data has to be in the same structure as in the zip file (i.e. starting with "UCI HAR Dataset" as the parent folder) and in your working directory
