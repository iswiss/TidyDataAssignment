# Code Book for Tidy Data Assignment

The dataset has 180 rows (30 subjects * 6 activities) and a total of 66 colums.
The data is organized in such a way that the dataset is grouped by subject and then activity.
All columns after the first two contain the average of the respective raw data. 
The raw data used to create the tidy dataset is described here:
